                Hi, I’m <strong>SLK</strong>, a highschool student passionate about using technology to create positive change. 
                I built this project to help reduce food waste and connect local communities through donations, awareness, and education. 
                My goal is to remind everyone that even small acts such as sharing a meal or spreading awareness can make a real difference.

            <p>
                Around <strong>700-800 million people</strong> worldwide don’t have enough food to lead a healthy life. 
                Food insecurity isn’t just about hunger—it’s about access to safe, nutritious, and affordable food.
                It affects families, students, and entire communities every single day.
            </p>

            <p>
                By reducing food waste, sharing surplus meals, and supporting local programs,
                you can help build a more sustainable and caring world. 
                Every small action, whether it's donating, volunteering, or spreading awareness can create real impact.
            </p>
